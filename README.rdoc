Data mining and machine learning algorithms for Ruby

== Installation

Install 'bundle' for JRuby before trying to install the 'ruby-mining' gem.
Maven is also required for .jars automatic download and installation. On
Ubuntu/Debian Maven should already be installed and on OSX system you can get
it from Brew

If you want to use 'bio-band' APIs without installing the gem you need
to run command 'rake -T' once before requiring the gem in your script
(this is necessary for jbundler to download the '.jar' files and subsequently
set the Java classpath)
Otherwise use:

        gem install bio-band

== Usage

== Developers

To use the library 

        require 'bio-band'

The API doc is online. For more code examples see also the test files in
the source tree.
